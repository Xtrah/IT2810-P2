# Project 2

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using node v14.17.0 and npm 6.14.13.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Setup and development

**NB! The environment variables need to be set before running the project for correct data fetching.**

### Setting environment variables

1. Make a file named `.env` in the projects root directory
2. Paste the following text into the `.env`-file:

   ```text
   REACT_APP_GITLAB_PROJECT_ACCESS_TOKEN=#AccessTokenFromGitlab
   REACT_APP_GITLAB_PROJECT_ID=#ProjectIdFromGitlab
   ```

3. **Get Gitlab access token:**

   - Go into your project in GitLab
   - Go to "Settings" --> "Access Tokens"
   - Choose a name, expiry-date and scopes
   - Click "Create project access token"
   - Substitute the received access token with `#AccessTokenFromGitlab` in the `.env`-file

4. **Get Gitlab project ID:**
   - Go to the "Project overview" page
   - The project ID can be copied from under the title of the project.
   - Substitute `#ProjectIdFromGitlab` with the retrieved project ID in the `.env`-file

### Running the project

After the variables are set, the relevant commands are:

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` to run app in development mode
- `npm run lint` to run prettier and eslint checks
- `npm test` to run [test runner](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) interactively
- `npm build` to minify and build for production to the `build` folder

## üìã Requirements

We divided each requirement for the project into issues, either as functional user stories or technical user stories.

### Content and feature requirements

#### Page elements and design

The application consists of several page elements:

- Title bar with theme button
- Summary of the statistics with a time scope menu
- Statistics

We used a simple material layout that retrieves data immediately on page load, where you can switch between light and dark mode.

#### Responsive web design

The site is responsive and compatible with most devices, using different techniques described in the [responsive layout](#Responsive_layout) section below.

#### HTML Web Storage

We used local storage to save the users theme-preference. This results in the theme persisting between each visit. Themeing is a personal preference which many users feel strongly about. Thus they can find it immensely annoying if such a setting does not persist. The implementation is in the form of a custom hook based on [this snippet](https://usehooks.com/useLocalStorage/). A custom hook provides for better readability and a greater level of reusability if we were to introduce more variables to save in local storage.

We used session storage for storing the user's selected time scope of GitLab statistics. We implemented this functionality in a custom hook, similar to the one mentioned above, as the functionality was very similar. Storing the setting in session storage made sure that the selected time scope in the dropdown menu stays selected when the user refreshes the page for the duration of the session. This is convenient when the user refreshes the page and expects to retrieve updated statistics for the selected time frame. Without session storage the time scope would reset to the default every time the page loads.

#### Presenting GitLab data parameterized

The page presents GitLab issue and commit statistics rendered using [Highcharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts), an external SVG-based charting library. We chose this as someone in the team had experience with it, it is popular and has good documentation.

For user parameterizing we chose to display data based on a chosen time frame. One solution for this was to fetch specific data on request. We chose not to do this, as it would lead to multiple fetches when changing time scopes and GitLab has a limit on API-calls.

Instead, we do all the data fetching when the app mounts. Then we filter the data on the client side according to what time scope is chosen by the user. As it's not expected that the data will change often, we found this a suitable solution.

### Technical requirements

#### React with TypeScript

The project uses the latest versions of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) at the time of development.

[Traditionally](https://www.twilio.com/blog/react-choose-functional-components) class components were used to handle state with option to define lifecycle methods, while functional components (FC) were used for presentation. This distinction does not stand with the arrival of hooks for state management and life cycle methods. In large we used FC, as it includes less boilerplate code, it avoids the confusing this-term and in sum can be more readable.

We used a class component in `App`. It acts as a parent component, fetching data in the lifecycle method `componentDidMount`. In a FC `useEffect` can be used to control the traditional life cycle methods. For example in `Statistics` we used `useEffect` to listen for changes in the data sent from `App`, which corresponds with CC's `componentDidUpdate`.

Since this was not a large app, we didn't feel the need to create a global store for the data fetching. Instead we drilled down the data from `App` and down the components using props. It was useful to utilize the context API for the theme toogling, as this affected all the styles.

External libraries/components used are:

- [Highcharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/highcharts) to render statistics in charts
- [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) for easier customization of React components
- [Dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for environment variables/project secrets
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) for Git hooks
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for formatting checks and code linting

#### Fetching GitLab data

We chose to use the built in function `fetch` for [data fetching](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-fetch-and-axios-js-for-making-http-requests/). We considered the external library `axios`, which allows for automatic transforming of json-data. On the contrary, with `fetch`, we have to do a two-step-process to first make the request, then call the json-method. This can make the functions cumbersome, adding more boilerplate lessening the readability and developer speed. Since there wouldn't be many fetch-definitions in the project (we only defined one), we found `fetch` to be suitable for our needs. This avoided adding more dependencies to the project.

#### Responsive layout

To make the layout of our web application responsive, we included a number of features to ensure flexibility in terms of scaling. Media queries were used to create breakpoints for differnet screen sizes and we used percentages to make the width of content wrappers dynamic. We chose to use a single breakpoint at `960px`. For the statistics, Highcharts already included dynamic scaling. Our solution has made the website easy to navigate and use when the screens become small, such as on a phone or small tablet.

Furthermore, we did not use viewport when creating and styling the layout of our web application. We came up with solutions we felt were solid in terms of responsiveness and scalability, and when we started considering using viewport, we concluded that this would require too much additional work to justify implemeting it.

## üß™ Testing

### Using Jest

Jest is a testing framework which is used for unit tests. We made use of its built in functions to test whether a utility function `getUniqueCommitContributors` gave expected output. Jest can also be expanded upon with other libraries. We made use of `react-test-renderer`, which allowed us to make snapshot tests. This makes a json-version of a component, letting you check if earlier representation matches the new representation of the component. We added snapshot tests checking if `StatisticsSummary` rendered as expected with or without data.

An easy, useful test is checking whether the app crashes. To do this, we used the render function from `@testing-library/react` to test `App`. We also wanted to test user interaction, specifically if toggle of theme worked. Here we used `@testing-library/user-event` to check if button click changed theme as expected.

### Testing UI and responsiveness

We wanted the phones and tablets with the most common screen aspect ratios to be supported. To achieve this we had to test the responsivenss of the UI throughly.

The testing was performed using chrome and safari. Using the chrome inspection tool, we tested mobile and tablet screen aspect ratios. This is a limited tool, but we consider it to be good enough for our application. From the project requirements we focused on testing on an ordinary pc screen and a phone in both horizontal and vertical orientation.

For each device that we tested, we ran the web application and ensured that it behaved as intended. If it did not, we rewrote code and checked if it still worked for the previously tested aspect ratios. We also ensured that the website behaved well when dynamically changing the window size.

In addition to only testing devices and screen sizes using the chrome inspection tool, we also tested the application on an iPhone 12 using both chrome and safari.

## ‚öóÔ∏è Code quality and use of Git

We made use of the formatting tools [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure a common coding style and good code quality. These were enforced with a pre-commit hook using [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) and a CI-pipeline on pull request and after merge. We also ran the test script in the pipeline to make sure functionality was as expected. We strived to extract logical groupings into their own components, and adding the components in their own folder `src/components`. Some functions were extracted into a `src/util` folder for reuse or to avoid cumbersome files. We strived to make variable- and function names descriptive, and also added comments for clarity.

We had a early meeting planning which tasks had to be done and decomposed them into manageable user stories. In development we strived following [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), describing commit messages in a common way and linking them to issues.
