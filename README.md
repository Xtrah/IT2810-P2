# Project 2

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using node v14.17.0 and npm 6.14.13.

## 👩‍💻 Setup and development

The environment variables need to be set before running the project for correct data fetching. After the variables are set, the relevant commands are:

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm start` to run app in development mode
- `npm run lint` to run prettier and eslint checks
- `npm test` to run [test runner](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) interactively
- `npm build` to minify and build for production to the `build` folder

### Setting environment variables

- make a `.env` file on root
- put the correct keys according to `.env.example` file
- **Getting Gitlab access token:** Go into your project in gitlab. Make a token on the page "Access tokens" under "Settings".
- **Getting Gitlab project ID:** On "Project overview" page, project ID can be copied from under the title of the project.
