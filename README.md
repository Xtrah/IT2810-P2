# Project 2

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Development

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start` to run app in development mode.
- `npm run lint` to run prettier and eslint checks
- `npm test` to run [test runner](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) interactively.
- `npm build` to minify and build for production to the `build` folder.
- `npm eject` to [remove the single build dependency](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts/#npm-run-eject) from the project.
